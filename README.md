#  OSA Corpus Growth Simulator

This is a **Streamlit app** built to simulate and compare different membership fee models for our Old Students Association (OSA).  
It helps us understand how the **corpus fund** grows over time based on alumni participation, yearly expenses, and donations.

  - **Total Alumni (last 30 years)**
  - **New Graduates per Year**
  - **Fresh Passouts Fee (‚Çπ)**
  - **Lifetime Fee (‚Çπ)**
  - **Renewable Fee (‚Çπ)**
  - **Renewal Cycle (Years)**

## How the Calculation Works

Each year, the model calculates:

1. **Fresh Joiners Fee**
   New Members √ó Fresh Fee

2. **Old Alumni Contribution**
- If Lifetime: One-time in year 1  
- If Renewable: At every renewal cycle
  Old Members √ó Lifetime/Renewal Fee

3. **Corpus Update**
   Corpus(t) = Corpus(t-1) √ó (1 + Interest Rate)
+ Fresh Fees + Renewal Fees + Donations
- Annual Costs
